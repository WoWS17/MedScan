### What is it?
Apache Kafka is an open-source event streaming platform that enables the management and processing of real-time data streams. It is designed for scalability, reliability and speed, enabling the transmission of large volumes of data between applications and systems. Kafka operates on a publish-subscribe model, where producers send data into containers called topics and consumers subscribe to the topics to receive the data.

### What is it?
Kibana is an free and open frontend application that sits on top of the  Elastic Stack, providing search and data visualization capabilities for  data indexed in Elasticsearch. Commonly known as the charting tool for  the Elastic Stack (previously referred to as the ELK Stack after  Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), Kibana also acts as the user  interface for monitoring, managing, and securing an Elastic Stack  cluster â€” as well as the centralized hub for built-in solutions  developed on the Elastic Stack. Developed in 2013 from within the  Elasticsearch community, Kibana has grown to become the window into the  Elastic Stack itself, offering a portal for users and companies.
